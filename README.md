# Quantum Amplitude Damping Channel

Bachelor's thesis project in computer engineering.

Professor: Matteo Rosati

Student: Remigiusz Gabryl Della Rosa

<!-- I'm following the paper [Discriminating qubit amplitude damping channels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01000.pdf) to understand the experiments and results described to optimize the input and measurement steps to discriminate amplitude damping channels. -->

In this repository there will be the documentation and quantum experiments implemented on IBM Qiskit tool.

<!-- ## How to get started

* Install Python requirements

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

* Install Qiskit latest version

```sh
pip install qiskit
```

* Check Qiskit Version

```sh
python basic-setup/qiskit-test.py
```

Should output at least these versions of Qiskit:

```json
{'qiskit-terra': '0.16.1', 'qiskit-aer': '0.7.2', 'qiskit-ignis': '0.5.1', 'qiskit-ibmq-provider': '0.11.1', 'qiskit-aqua': '0.8.1', 'qiskit': '0.23.2'}
```

* Open `gettingStarted` notebook and run all cells to check that your system is working

* You should already have an IBM Quantum Experience account. You can create one following these steps [Create an IBM Quantum Experience account](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html).

* Once created, check that you can retrieve your account on a given notebook. Open `load-ibm-provider` notebook and run the cells to check that you can load your account successfully and select a Quantum backend. -->
